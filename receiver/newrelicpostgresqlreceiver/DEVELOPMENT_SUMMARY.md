# New Relic PostgreSQL Receiver Development Summary

## Completed Work

### 1. Core Receiver Structure
- ✅ Created `receiver/newrelicpostgresqlreceiver/` directory
- ✅ Implemented all core receiver files:
  - `metadata.yaml` - Defines New Relic-specific metrics and attributes
  - `config.go` - Configuration structure with New Relic-specific options
  - `factory.go` - Factory functions for creating the receiver
  - `scraper.go` - Main scraping logic (simplified from original)
  - `doc.go` - Package documentation with go:generate directive
  - `README.md` - Comprehensive user documentation

### 2. Generated Metadata
- ✅ Successfully ran `mdatagen` to generate proper metadata files
- ✅ Generated internal/metadata package with all metric builders
- ✅ Fixed metadata.yaml to match expected schema
- ✅ All New Relic-specific metrics are properly defined

### 3. New Relic Performance Monitoring
- ✅ Created `newrelic_performance.go` with comprehensive query performance monitoring
- ✅ Implemented collection for:
  - Slow queries with detailed metrics
  - Wait events and timing
  - Blocking sessions detection
  - Execution plans (framework ready)
  - Individual query performance metrics
- ✅ Log generation for slow query events

### 4. Database Connection and Client
- ✅ Adapted PostgreSQL client from original receiver
- ✅ Added Query method to client interface
- ✅ Implemented client factory pattern
- ✅ Fixed all database connection logic

### 5. Build and Testing
- ✅ Receiver builds successfully without errors
- ✅ All dependencies properly managed with go.mod
- ✅ Tests pass (with expected goroutine warnings)
- ✅ All imports and references correctly updated

## Key Features Implemented

### New Relic-Specific Metrics
- `postgresql.query.execution.count` - Query execution frequency
- `postgresql.query.avg_elapsed_time` - Average query execution time
- `postgresql.query.avg_disk_reads` - Average disk reads per query
- `postgresql.query.avg_disk_writes` - Average disk writes per query
- `postgresql.query.cpu_time` - CPU time consumed by queries
- `postgresql.wait.event.total_time` - Wait event timing
- `postgresql.blocking.session.pid` - Blocking session identification
- `postgresql.blocked.session.pid` - Blocked session identification
- `postgresql.execution_plan.*` - Execution plan analysis metrics

### Configuration Options
```yaml
newrelic_query_performance:
  enabled: true
  slow_query_threshold: 1000ms
  wait_event_threshold: 100ms
  blocking_session_threshold: 5s
  execution_plan_threshold: 2s
  collection_interval: 60s
  query_plan_cache_size: 1000
  query_plan_cache_ttl: 24h
```

### Log Generation
- Slow query detection with detailed context
- Structured logging with query metadata
- Integration with OpenTelemetry logs pipeline

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
1. **Scraper Pattern**: Follows OpenTelemetry receiver scraper pattern
2. **Factory Pattern**: Uses factory pattern for client creation
3. **Builder Pattern**: Uses generated metadata builders for metrics/logs
4. **Configuration**: Extends base PostgreSQL config with New Relic options

### Database Queries
- Slow query detection via pg_stat_statements
- Wait event monitoring via pg_stat_activity  
- Blocking session detection via pg_locks + pg_stat_activity
- Execution plan collection via EXPLAIN (framework ready)

### Performance Considerations
- Query plan caching with TTL
- Configurable collection intervals
- Threshold-based monitoring to reduce overhead
- Connection pooling support

## Next Steps for Production

### 1. Enhanced Testing
- Add unit tests for New Relic performance collector
- Add integration tests with real PostgreSQL instances
- Add benchmark tests for performance validation

### 2. Production Hardening
- Add connection error handling and retries
- Implement graceful degradation for missing permissions
- Add metrics collection success/failure tracking
- Optimize database queries for performance

### 3. Documentation
- Add example configurations
- Document required PostgreSQL permissions
- Create troubleshooting guide
- Add performance tuning recommendations

### 4. Additional Features
- Support for PostgreSQL version detection and adaptation
- Enhanced execution plan analysis
- Query normalization and grouping
- Historical trend analysis

## Summary

The New Relic PostgreSQL receiver is now functional and ready for further development. It successfully:

1. ✅ Builds and compiles without errors
2. ✅ Implements New Relic-style query performance monitoring
3. ✅ Integrates with OpenTelemetry framework
4. ✅ Provides comprehensive configuration options
5. ✅ Generates both metrics and logs
6. ✅ Follows OpenTelemetry best practices and patterns

The receiver can now be tested with real PostgreSQL instances and further refined based on production requirements.
